Build a basic website about a topic of your choice (It can not be yourself). Have fun with it! 
Include at least 3 different pages that link to each other. 
Once we've covered responsiveness in class, you can include those features into your website.
After you're done, upload your project folder on github and submit the url to your online repository. -->
